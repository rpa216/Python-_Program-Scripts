# Python-_Program-Scripts
This repository has been created keeping into consideration of the python program parathesis checker
1. Parantheis checker
2. Simple Word tokenizer
3. TFID score calculator for tokens

4. Robotic Process Automation tools
Basic working of the program was to create a robotic process automation tool for developing a SOX report.The program   operation library that were created could be used in various other operational purpose were based library of paramiko for SSH connection and normal os and sys libraries and python autogui library. The program was develop to reduce the human working effort in creating SOX report(SAP systems audit report). The basic purpose of the report is the give the current status and auditing report of the client system. The program has been written using a modular approach, were the CA01 and CA02 are two modules of the report and different functions are written for transaction that can be performed in the SAP system which were important for auditing of the SAP system. I have attached a video of the one modular implementation that I have written, also I had written a program to automate prechecks on linux server using SAP SWPM tool  for which I there also a small video demo of the implementation,however currently I cannot find the program on my computer.
library files -- Simulate, GUI_Auto, OpsAuto
program files -- SOX_Auto, CA01, CA02
